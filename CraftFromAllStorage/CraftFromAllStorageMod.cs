/*
 * Ideas
 * Render a sprite above / in front of a container like the island loot mod? - perhaps when you focus it (OnRayed?
 * An Item Sign that renders what is inside a storage chest?
 * All In One inventory that opens by default when you press tab? - should render all storages on your raft.
 * Craft From storage, should craft from all chests, not only your local one.
 * - if you have a storage open, prefer taking items from that one. else take it from the other storages.
 * Hold modifiers to increase how many are crafted when pressing the craft button.
